LivePipe UI is a suite of high quality widgets and controls for web 2.0 applications built using the [Prototype JavaScript Framework](http://prototypejs.org/). Each control is well tested, highly extensible, fully documented and degrades gracefully for non JavaScript enabled browsers where possible.
